Let's trace "echo (a)" step by step:

1. readline: "echo (a)"
2. fixspaces: "echo (a)" (no change - parentheses are not operators)
3. expansionprepartion (stage1):
   - Splits only on quotes
   - Result: One NQ token: "echo (a)"
4. joining:
   - Token is NQ, so mimicp is called
   - Adds wrapper: "(echo (a))"
   - Converts literals: "(echo \x01a\x02)"
5. finalize_joining:
   - Calls fix(joined, "echo (a)", count)
   - getlastspace("echo (a)") = 4 (space after echo)
   - Condition: if (4 == -1 && count != 1) is FALSE
   - So fix() does NOT remove wrapper
6. preparation.c - wordcount:
   - Sees "(echo \x01a\x02)"
   - First char is '(', so it's a quoted section
   - Counts as 1 word? NO!
   - It extracts "echo \x01a\x02" from inside ()
   - Then counts words by spaces inside
   - Result: 2 words ("echo" and "\x01a\x02")
7. getword extracts each word
8. restore_parentheses converts \x01 and \x02 back
9. Final: args=["echo", "(a)"]

This SHOULD work! So why doesn't it?
